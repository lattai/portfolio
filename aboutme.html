    <h2><ins> Bio</ins></h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Leah Attai is a 15 year old sudent from Bridgeport CT. 
    She is a junior attending Greens Farms Academy in Westport.
    Leah is a participant of the <i>Girls Who Code</i> Summer 
    Immersion Program during the summer of 2017.</p>\

    <h2><ins>GWC Projects</ins><h2>
      <h3><u>Drawing Shapes</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some 
        similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Scratch and Python are very similar as far as comands go,
      however Scratch has a much simpler and more user friendly interface than Python, but I feel that
      Python is more straight forward and direct.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program.
        How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I found debugging to be a bit frustrating, but it made
      finding the correct code all the more exciting! The toughest part is remembering every bit of syntax.</p>
    <br>
      <h3><u>Circuits</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Today I learned more about circuits and the parts involved. I am very excited for 
        this unit of robotics, especially because I am not as familiar with circuits and breadboards. My group of 5 was able
        to identify and define parts of the circuit, and proceed in creating circuits using the Board of Education board. 
        We created a blinking LED, and solid LED, added buttons, and created 2 LEDs in series and in parallel.
        Unfortunately, we were unable to add in the piezo, but we believe it might be because we had not programed the 
        arduino. None the less, it was really cool to see how the circuits worked. </p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> We talked a lot about robots and their ethics today. How did your idea of robotics
        change? What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous?</b> </p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">Robots are cool and exciting, but they are meant to replicate and replace human
      activities. I look forward to robotic advancements that with improved accuracy and precision help people where
      human error can fail, but not quite to a place where people are put out of work because of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest
        of the week. What worked well? What could you do better next time? </b> </p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Words can't quite explain how excited I am for this unit due to my love for robotics.
        Because of this, I was an eager and speedy learner, and at times I could be unintentionally taking over projects.
        I try fixing this by asking my group mates if they have questions, or what they've found, or if they want to try, 
        but sometimes, their answers aren't as enthusiastic as mine. It is very much something I need to improve upon.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><u>Robotics</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> What did you learn? How well did your team work together?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">I learned how to use the whisker sensor. The whisker sensor is a touch sensor. I also 
        learned about the motors, beacause yesterday, I worked mostly with the piezo. </p>
      <br>
      <h3><u>Internet</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Write about one new thing you learned about how the internet works.</p></b>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> From making the plays with Andrea, Rebecca, and Kristal, I had a better understanding 
        of the router's role in how the internet works and information is sent from computer to computer.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>LaTeX is a language that allows people to format documents, and is frequently used
        to write academic Math and CS texts. Based on this description, is LaTeX a markup or programming language?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> LaTeX is a markup language because it is used for the processing or presenting of text
      rather than being used to build applications or have the computer work through functions.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>What would you like more practice using?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Well, I stoped at the 'Deploy!' tab of the Django Girls tutorial, so I've still got a
        lot to learn, that is certain. Firtstly, I would really love to have the nenw site have it's own URL that can be 
        accessed on any computer, that would be neat.</p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What would you like to add to your Django site?</p></b>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Besides the URL, I would really like for my Django site to have lots of animations
        to make the user excited to use my site. I can't be the only one who trusts a site less if the webpage looks 
        unprofessional.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>What dynamic feature would you like to learn about next?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I would love to learn more about animations. Making websites react to
        certain commands is pretty  cool.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>What other sites could you create with the same structure as you 
        used in your portfolio page?</b></p> 
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> We've seen examples of social media sites using Django. With the same 
        structure as our portfolio page, sites like Instagram or Pinterest could be created.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><u>Data Structures</u></h3>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>What makes computers good at data?</b></p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Computers use logic to organize objects efficiently.</p>
     
    <br>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>Why would you use a dictionary vs a list? What are the similarities 
      and differences between the two?</b></p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Dictionarys are used for key:value sets to be stored. Lists are items with the 
      just one set of values. Dictionaries are in no specified order, so when printed, the output is randomized. Lists keep 
      the order they are entered in. Both are used to store data, and can be used to create dataframes.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Algorithms</h3></u>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What are you most proud of figuring out today?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">I am very proud of figuring out the bubble sort code without being able to run it.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What algorithm was most interesting to you and why?</b></p>
      
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">The Dijksta algorithm is super neat, as was the Neural Network algorithm. Both 
        neatly show how data can be sorted and organized.</p>
      <br>
    <h3><u>Social Network</h3></u>
     <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What are some of the limitations of your social network program form yesterday?</p></b>
     <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Rigth now, my social network can have users and their emails be input to the list of users,
       and now I'm working on making connections work for a pair of users.</p>
  <br>  
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What features would be useful and/or interesting to add?</p></b>
   <p style="font-family:verdana;">I think that it  would be useful for a user to have a password or other attribute to add on. </p>
    <br>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What are you most proud of figuring out today?</p></b>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">I"m proud of being able to help my friends out on their codes. I don't consider myself very good at explaining
  things, but by being able to explain it proves my new understanding of the topic.</p>
  <br>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><b>What are you most excited about for final projects?</b></p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;">I am super excited to see how we can create something that will really help people. That sounds  wonderful. </p>
