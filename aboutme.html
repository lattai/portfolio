    <h2><ins>Projects</ins><h2>
      <h3><u>Drawing Shapes</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some 
        similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Scratch and Python are very similar as far as comands go,
      however Scratch has a much simpler and more user friendly interface than Python, but I feel that
      Python is more straight forward and direct.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program.
        How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I found debugging to be a bit frustrating, but it made
      finding the correct code all the more exciting! The toughest part is remembering every bit of syntax.</p>
    <br>
      <h3><u>Circuits</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Today I learned more about circuits and the parts involved. I am very excited for 
        this unit of robotics, especially because I am not as familiar with circuits and breadboards. My group of 5 was able
        to identify and define parts of the circuit, and proceed in creating circuits using the Board of Education board. 
        We created a blinking LED, and solid LED, added buttons, and created 2 LEDs in series and in parallel.
        Unfortunately, we were unable to add in the piezo, but we believe it might be because we had not programed the 
        arduino. None the less, it was really cool to see how the circuits worked. </p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> We talked a lot about robots and their ethics today. How did your idea of robotics
        change? What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous?</b> </p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">Robots are cool and exciting, but they are meant to replicate and replace human
      activities. I look forward to robotic advancements that with improved accuracy and precision help people where
      human error can fail, but not quite to a place where people are put out of work because of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest
        of the week. What worked well? What could you do better next time? </b> </p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Words can't quite explain how excited I am for this unit due to my love for robotics.
        Because of this, I was an eager and speedy learner, and at times I could be unintentionally taking over projects.
        I try fixing this by asking my group mates if they have questions, or what they've found, or if they want to try, 
        but sometimes, their answers aren't as enthusiastic as mine. It is very much something I need to improve upon.</p>
      <br>
      <h3><u>Robotics</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b> What did you learn? How well did your team work together?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">I learned how to use the whisker sensor. The whisker sensor is a touch sensor. I also 
        learned about the motors, beacause yesterday, I worked mostly with the piezo. </p>
