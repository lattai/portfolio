      <h3><u>Drawing Shapes</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some 
        similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Scratch and Python are very similar as far as comands go,
      however Scratch has a much simpler and more user friendly interface than Python, but I feel that
      Python is more straight forward and direct.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> <b>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program.
        How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?</b></p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I found debugging to be a bit frustrating, but it made
      finding the correct code all the more exciting! The toughest part is remembering every bit of syntax.</p>
    <br>
      <h3><u>Circuits</u></h3>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Today I learned more about circuits and the parts involved. I am very excited for 
        this unit of robotics, especially because I am not as familiar with circuits and breadboards. My group of 5 was able
        to identify and define parts of the circuit, and proceed in creating circuits using the Board of Education board. 
        We created a blinking LED, and solid LED, added buttons, and created 2 LEDs in series and in parallel.
        Unfortunately, we were unable to add in the piezo, but we believe it might be because we had not programed the 
        arduino. None the less, it was really cool to see how the circuits worked. </p>
